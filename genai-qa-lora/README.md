# 🧠 General-Purpose QA with LoRA + Gradio

This notebook demonstrates a minimal implementation of a **Question-Answering (QA)** system using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to fine-tune a transformer model. It is deployed with **Gradio** for interactive use.

The project serves as a starting point for applying **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** to create custom QA systems across various domains — such as legal, insurance, healthcare, or customer support — using small-scale task-specific datasets.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Uses **PEFT (LoRA)** to fine-tune a base transformer model on a small QA dataset.
- Deploys the QA model via a **Gradio** interface.
- Designed as a flexible template for domain-specific adaptation.
- Optimized to run in Google Colab with GPU support.
